v3.1
Frank Young debuged the fan.h and fan.h hac no warning now.
change l3 from create

v3.0
ready to make topo bigger with 8 processes.

v2.0 
O	throughput represents edge_weight.
O	process cpu usage represents point_weight.
O	queuelength / max_queuelength to notify that CPU is congested.
O	packet_sending sends packets more slowly than that in v1.0 who sends using up all CPU0.

get new fan.h with DPI
we may add new nDPI to the topo and make topo larger.

decide whether we should edit the extended_KL.h for double's accuracy with EPSILON(maybe useless)

edit the nfv process in fan.h with the loop of while and idle_i to promote the nfv's cpu usage
